What is a binomial experiment?;binomial experiment (also called a Bernoulli trial). The key characteristics of a binomial experiment are that we have a fixed number of trials (e.g., 100 taste testers), each with two possible outcomes (Schlitz or Michelob), and the probability of “success” is the same in each trial. (I am assuming the probability of picking one beer or the other is 50 percent, and I am defining “success” as a tester picking Schlitz.) We also assume that all the “trials” are independent, meaning that one blind taste tester’s decision has no impact on any other tester’s decision.
